## Intro

**Natural language processing** (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. Can read more regarding NLP from this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and also this [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence/artificial_intelligence_natural_language_processing.htm)

## Goal


## Data set


## Tools 

In order to solve this nlp problem. I used python3 as programming language and spacy and scikit-learn libraries. 

* spacy:
spaCy is a free and open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python with a lot of in-built capabilities. It’s becoming increasingly popular for processing and analyzing data in NLP. Unstructured textual data is produced at a large scale, and it’s important to process and derive insights from unstructured data. To do that, you need to represent the data in a format that can be understood by computers. NLP can help you do that.

* scikit-learn
